<div class="row">
  <div class="column" >
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Improving the maternal and child health and their survival are central to the achievement of national health goals under the National Health Mission (NHM). SDG Goal 3 also includes the focus on reducing maternal, newborn and child mortality. In the past years, innovative strategies evolved under the national programme to deliver evidence-based interventions to various population groups.

        Following the Government of India’s “Call to Action (CAT) Summit” in February, 2013, the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare launched Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn Child plus Adolescent Health (RMNCH+A) to influence the key interventions for reducing maternal and child morbidity and mortality. 
        
        The RMNCH+A strategy is built upon the continuum of care concept and is holistic in design, encompassing all interventions aimed at reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health under a broad umbrella, and focusing on the strategic lifecycle approach.
        </p>
<h3>The RMNCH+A strategy promotes links between various interventions across thematic areas to enhance coverage throughout the lifecycle to improve child survival in India. The “plus” within the strategy focuses on:</h3>
        <p><ul><li>Inclusion of adolescence as a distinct life stage within the overall strategy.</li>
    <li> Linking maternal and child health to reproductive health and other components like family planning, adolescent health, HIV, gender, and preconception and prenatal diagnostic techniques.</li>
    <li>Linking home and community-based services to facility-based services.</li>
    <li>Ensuring linkages, referrals, and counter-referrals between and among various levels of health care system to create a continuous care pathway, and to bring an additive /synergistic effect in terms of overall outcomes and impact.</li>
</ul></p>
<h2>Key features of RMNCH+A Strategy:</h2>
<p>The RMNCH+A strategy approaches include:</p>
<p><ul><li>Health systems strengthening (HSS) focusing on infrastructure, human resources, supply chain management, and referral transport measures.</li>
    <li>Prioritization of high-impact interventions for various lifecycle stages.</li>
    <li>Increasing effectiveness of investments by prioritizing geographical areas based on evidence.
    </li>
    <li>Integrated monitoring and accountability through good governance, use of available data sets, community involvement, and steps to address grievance</li>
    <li>Broad-based collaboration and partnerships with ministries, departments, development partners, civil society, and other stakeholders.</li></ul></p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column" >
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Under National Rural Health Mission, significant progress has been made in reducing
        mortality in children over the last seven years (2005-12). Whereas there is an advance in
        reducing child mortality there is a dire need to improving survival outcome. This would be
        reached by early detection and management of conditions that were not addressed
        comprehensively in the past.
        According to March of Dimes (2006), out of every 100 babies born in this country annually,
        6 to 7 have a birth defect. This would translate to around 17 lakhs birth defects annually in
        the country and accounts for 9.6% of all the newborn deaths. Various nutritional
        deficiencies affecting the preschool children range from 4 per cent to 70 per cent.
        Developmental delays are common in early childhood affecting at least 10 percent of the
        children. These delays if not intervened timely may lead to permanent disabilities including
        cognitive, hearing or vision impairment. Also, there are group of diseases common in
        children viz. dental caries, rheumatic heart disease, reactive airways diseases etc. Early
        detection and management diseases including deficiencies bring added value in preventing
        these conditions to progress to its more severe and debilitating form and thereby reducing
        hospitalization and improving implementation of Right to Education</p>
        <p>Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) is an important initiative aiming at early
            identification and early intervention for children from birth to 18 years to cover 4 ‘D’s viz.
            Defects at birth, Deficiencies, Diseases, Development delays including disability.
            It is important to note that the 0-6 years age group will be specifically managed at District
            Early Intervention Center (DEIC) level while for 6-18 years age group, management of
            conditions will be done through existing public health facilities. DEIC will act as referral
            linkages for both the age groups.
            First level of screening is done at all delivery points through existing Medical Officers, Staff
            Nurses and ANMs. After 48 hours till 6 weeks the screening of newborns will be done by
            ASHA at home as a part of Home Based New-born Care (HBNC) package.
            Outreach screening will be done by dedicated Mobile Health teams for 6 weeks to 6 years at
            anganwadis centres and 6-18 years children at school.</p>
            <p>Once the child is screened and referred from any of these points of identification, it would be
                ensured that the necessary treatment/intervention is delivered at zero cost to the family.</p>
<h2>Target age group</h2>
        <p>The services aim to cover children of 0-6 years of age in rural areas and urban slums in addition to
            children enrolled in classes 1st to 12th in Government and Government aided Schools. It is expected
            that these services will reach to about 27 crores children in a phased manner. The broad category of
            age group and estimated beneficiary is as shown below in the table. The children have been grouped
            in to three categories owing to the fact that different sets of tools would be used and also different set
            of conditions could be prioritized.</p>

<a name="scheme4"><h1> Mission Indradhanush</h1></a>


<div class="row">
  <div class="column" >
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Immunization Programme in India was introduced in 1978 as ‘Expanded Programme of Immunization’ (EPI) by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. In 1985, the programme was modified as ‘Universal Immunization Programme’ (UIP) to be implemented in phased manner to cover all districts in the country by 1989-90 with the one of largest health programme in the world. Despite being operational for many years, UIP has been able to fully immunize only 65% children in the first year of their life.

        Through UIP, Government of India is providing vaccination free of cost against vaccine preventable diseases include diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, measles, severe form of childhood tuberculosis, hepatitis B, meningitis and pneumonia (Hemophilus influenza type B infections), Japanese encephalitis (JE) in JE endemic districts with introduction of newer vaccines  such as rotavirus vaccine, IPV, adult JE vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV)  and measles-rubella (MR) vaccine in UIP/national immunization programme.</p>
<h2>Mission Indradhanush</h2>
        <p>To strengthen and re-energize the programme and achieve full immunization coverage for all children and pregnant women at a rapid pace, the Government of India launched “Mission Indradhanush” in December 2014.</p>
<h2>Goal of Mission Indradhanush:</h2>
<p>The ultimate goal of Mission Indradhanush is to ensure full immunization with all available vaccines for children up to two years of age and pregnant women. The Government has identified 201 high focus districts across 28 states in the country that have the highest number of partially immunized and unimmunized children.

    Earlier the increase in full immunization coverage was 1% per year which has increased to 6.7% per year through the first two phases of Mission Indradhanush. Four phases of Mission Indradhanush have been conducted till August 2017 and more than 2.53 crore children and 68 lakh pregnant women have been vaccinated. </p>
    <h2>Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI)</h2>
<p>To further intensify the immunization programme, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi launched the Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) on October 8, 2017. Through this programme, Government of India aims to reach each and every child up to two years of age and all those pregnant women who have been left uncovered under the routine immunisation programme/UIP. The focus of special drive was to improve immunisation coverage in select districts and cities to ensure full immunisation to more than 90% by December 2018.

    Under IMI, four consecutive immunization rounds were conducted for 7 days in 173 districts (121 districts and 17 cities in 16 states and 52 districts in 8 northeastern states) every month between October 2017 and January 2018. Intensified Mission Indradhanush has covered low performing areas in the selected districts (high priority districts) and urban areas. Special attention was given to unserved/low coverage pockets in sub-centre and urban slums with migratory population. The focus was also on the urban settlements and cities identified under National Urban Health Mission (NUHM).</p>
    <h2>Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) 2.0</h2>
    <p>To boost the routine immunization coverage in the country, Government of India has introduced Intensified Mission Indradhanush 2.0 to ensure reaching the unreached with all available vaccines and accelerate the coverage of children and pregnant women in the identified districts and blocks from December 2019-March 2020.

        The IMI 2.0 aims to achieve targets of full immunization coverage in 272 districts in 27 States and at block level (652 blocks) in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar among hard-to-reach and tribal populations.
        
         With the launch of Intensified Mission Indradhanush 2.0, India has the opportunity to achieve further reductions in deaths among children under five years of age, and achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of ending preventable child deaths by 2030.
        
        Several ministries, including the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Panchayati Raj, Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Youth Affairs and others have come together to make the mission a resounding success and support the central government in ensuring the benefits of vaccines reach the last mile.</p>
        <h3>The salient features of IMI 2.0 are:</h3>
        <p><ul><li>Conduction of four rounds of immunization activity over 7 working days excluding the RI days, Sundays and holidays.</li>
            <li>Enhanced immunization session with flexible timing, mobile session and mobilization by other departments.</li>
            <li>Enhanced focus on left outs, dropouts, and resistant families and hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>Focus on urban, underserved population and tribal areas.</li>
            <li>Inter-ministerial and inter-departmental coordination.</li>
            <li>Enhance political, administrative and financial commitment, through advocacy.</li></ul></p>
